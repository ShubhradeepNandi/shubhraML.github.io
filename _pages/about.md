Hi there, I'm Shubhradeep Nandi, or you can call me Shubhra.

I graduated from Computer Science and Engineering in India. I did BI and Analytics management diploma from IIM Bangalore. My research during management was primarily focused on devicing analytical prescriptions for Unorganized Retail in India.

I'm currently living and working in Bangalore. I'm a big fan of Automation, Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I'm doing some works on Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I'm also maintaining this blog to share my knowledge about ML and CV, as well as my work on both fields. 


Hope this blog help with your learning. And don't hesitate to drop me a line. I'll reply as soon as I can :)
